    World leaders raced to congratulate Donald Trump yesterday as he triumphed in a stunning US election victory over Kamala Harris.
    
    
    European leaders in particular were quick to extend their best wishes and offers of cooperation, in contrast to a much cooler reaction when Trump won for the first time in 2016.
